\title{The Formation Operator Term}
\usage{
# binary: Form(formula)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{model formula}
}
\description{
This term accepts a model formula
and produces the corresponding model for the post-formation network:
effectively a network containing both previous time step's ties and ties just formed,
the union of the previous and current network. This is the equivalent of the
old-style \code{formation} model.
