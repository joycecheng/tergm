\title{Weighted sum of ages of extant ties}
\usage{
# binary: edgecov.ages(x, attrname=NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, attrname}{either a square matrix of covariates, one for each possible
edge in the network, the name of a network attribute of covariates,
or a network; if the latter, optional argument \code{attrname} provides
the name of the quantitative edge attribute to use for covariate values
(in this case, missing edges in \code{x} are assigned a covariate value
of zero).}
}
\description{
This term adds one statistic equaling sum, over all ties
present in the network, of the amount of time elapsed since
formation, multiplied by a dyadic covariate.

"Weights" can be negative.

Unlike \code{\link[=edgecov.mean.age-ergmTerm]{edgecov.mean.age}} , this statistic is well-defined on
an empty network. However, if used as a target, it appears to
produce highly biased dissolution parameter estimates if the goal
is to get an intended average duration.
